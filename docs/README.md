# Package Overview
The `specrel` package represents physical things and spacetime processes as geometric objects that can be transformed and plotted. Most core geometry classes are defined in `geom`, with a few extra defined in `spacetime`. Geometry objects are plotted and animated in different ways with classes defined in the `graphics` subpackage. The `visualize` module provides an easier-to-use API for common plot types.

# Guided Tour
The [guided tour](guided_tour) is a series of demo modules that show off practical application of various features of the `specrel` package, alongside an introduction to topics is special relativity.
